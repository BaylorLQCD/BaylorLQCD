The current disconloops, working and inverters file being used is the "bootstrapped" version intended to accelerate convergence of the hermitian system. Should you wish to use the original version, rename disconloops-original.f90 and inverters-original.f90 to disconloops.f90 and inverters.f90
and the same with working-original.f90
