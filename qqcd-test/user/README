IMPORTANT INFO

In the cfgspropsmain.f90 file:

Replace YOURKODIAKUSER with your kodiak user name, and scratch with the name of the desired directory you would like your data output to in

rwdir = "/data/YOURKODIAKUSER/qqcd/scratch/"

This makes sure that the data output by the program is output to your data directory in the directory you replace scratch with

If you are starting from scratch you will have to "mkdir qqcd" in your data directory.
Within qqcd, use mkdir again to create a directory with the name of your choosing. This is where your data will be output to. This directory must have the same name as the directory you specify in

/qqcd-test/bin/job_sub.sh

for removing the scratch files

Within this directory, use "mkdir cfgfiles". Your configuration and lagfib files MUST be placed in the cfgfiles directory!!
